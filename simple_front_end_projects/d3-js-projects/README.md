This repository contains some projects using [D3.js].

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps 
you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards 
gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a 
proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a 
data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
