# Contributing Guidelines

This guide will help you to contribute to this project smoothly. Please, read carefully to make your contribution process easier.

Usually, this project has two types of contributions: _new examples_ and _translations_.

## New Examples

**New examples will be accepted only if they have an explanation.** Preferably, the explanation should contain links to the specification, blog posts, forum publications.

If you don't know why an example works the way it works, ask for help on [the discussion forum](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs/discussions).

Issues without explanations will be closed.

## Translations

**If you want a translation, please, make one.** Issues with translation requests will be closed in favor of PRs.

Before sending a PR with translation, please check if there are any existing PRs with translation to your language.

**You have to find someone who speaks your language natively to read, check and verify your translation.** That's how we are trying to prevent typos and mistakes.
